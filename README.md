# 📊 React Admin Test Project  

## Overview  
This project is a lightweight **admin dashboard** built with **React Admin**, a popular framework for creating data-driven admin interfaces. It connects to a mock REST API (**JSONPlaceholder**) and provides a simple way to **browse, view, and manage posts and users** through a responsive interface.  

I built this project because I wanted to **practice React Admin** and see how it works in real projects. I’ve heard that some companies use it for internal tooling and admin dashboards, and since it’s quite popular in the industry, I wanted to get hands-on experience with it.

## 🎮 How to Use  
- Open the **Posts** tab to view a list of posts fetched via the API.  
- Each row displays details like **User ID, Post ID, Title, and Body**.  
- Clicking on a row allows you to view more information (and in a full setup, could allow editing/deleting).  
- React Admin automatically handles **pagination, sorting, and filtering**.
